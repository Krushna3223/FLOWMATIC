## üîç **Step-by-Step Fix for 403 Error**

### **Step 1: Enable Google Drive API**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Library"**
4. Search for **"Google Drive API"**
5. Click on **"Google Drive API"**
6. Click **"Enable"** button
7. Wait for it to show **"API enabled"**

### **Step 2: Check API Key Restrictions**

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Credentials"**
2. Find your API key: `AIzaSyCVgOV055ZyAmnD4zDXLPGIkBjc60QzQMI`
3. **Click on the API key** to edit it
4. Under **"API restrictions"**, make sure it shows:
   - ‚úÖ **"Restrict key"** is selected
   - ‚úÖ **"Google Drive API"** is in the list
5. If not, select **"Restrict key"** and add **"Google Drive API"**
6. Click **"Save"**

### **Step 3: Enable Billing (If Required)**

1. Go to **"Billing"** in the left menu
2. Make sure billing is enabled for your project
3. Some APIs require billing to be enabled

### **Step 4: Check Project Permissions**

1. Go to **"IAM & Admin"** ‚Üí **"IAM"**
2. Make sure your account has proper permissions
3. You should have at least **"Editor"** role

### **Step 5: Alternative - Create New API Key**

If the above doesn't work, create a new API key:

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Credentials"**
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** ‚Üí **"API Key"**
3. Copy the new API key
4. **Immediately** click on the new API key to edit it
5. Set restrictions:
   - **API restrictions**: Select "Restrict key"
   - **Select APIs**: Choose "Google Drive API"
6. Click **"Save"**
7. Update the code with the new API key

### **Step 6: Test the Fix**

1. Go to your app: `http://localhost:3000/gdrive-test`
2. Click **"Test Connection"**
3. Check the console for detailed logs

## üîß **Quick Alternative: Use Firebase Storage**

If Google Drive continues to have issues, we can use Firebase Storage instead:

### **Benefits of Firebase Storage:**
- ‚úÖ Already configured with your Firebase project
- ‚úÖ No API key restrictions
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ Secure and reliable

### **To Switch to Firebase Storage:**

1. The Firebase Storage integration is already implemented
2. Just change the storage type to "Firebase Storage" in the upload component
3. No additional setup required

## üìã **Checklist**

- [ ] Google Drive API is enabled
- [ ] API key has "Google Drive API" restriction
- [ ] Billing is enabled (if required)
- [ ] Project permissions are correct
- [ ] Test connection works

## üÜò **If Still Not Working**

1. **Try Firebase Storage** - It's already set up and will work immediately
2. **Check console logs** - Look for detailed error messages
3. **Verify project ID** - Make sure you're in the right Google Cloud project
4. **Wait a few minutes** - API changes can take time to propagate

## üöÄ **Recommended Solution**

Since you already have Firebase set up, I recommend using **Firebase Storage** instead:

1. It's already configured
2. No API key issues
3. Works with your existing authentication
4. More reliable for your use case
