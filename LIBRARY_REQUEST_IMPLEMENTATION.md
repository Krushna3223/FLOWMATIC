# Library Resource and Timing Requirements Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of library resource and timing requirements in the ERP system. The system provides a comprehensive workflow for managing library resource requests and timing change requests with proper approval hierarchies.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Library Resource Requests
- **Purpose**: Allow students and staff to request new library resources (books, journals, magazines, etc.)
- **Approval Flow**: Student → Assistant Librarian → Registrar → Principal
- **Features**:
  - Multiple resource types (book, journal, magazine, reference, digital, equipment, other)
  - Priority levels (low, medium, high)
  - Detailed descriptions and additional information
  - Complete approval tracking with history
  - Status tracking (pending, approved, rejected)

### 2. Library Timing Requests
- **Purpose**: Allow Assistant Librarians to request changes to library operating hours
- **Approval Flow**: Assistant Librarian → Registrar → Principal
- **Features**:
  - Detailed timing specifications (start/end times, days, date ranges)
  - Reason documentation
  - Priority levels
  - Complete approval tracking
  - Status tracking

## Database Structure

### Firebase Rules
```json
{
  "libraryResourceRequests": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "$requestId": {
      ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['title', 'description', 'resourceType', 'priority', 'status', 'createdBy', 'createdByName', 'createdAt', 'currentApproverRole', 'approvalFlow', 'history'])"
    }
  },
  "libraryTimingRequests": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "$requestId": {
      ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['title', 'description', 'requestedTiming', 'reason', 'priority', 'status', 'createdBy', 'createdByName', 'createdAt', 'currentApproverRole', 'approvalFlow', 'history'])"
    }
  }
